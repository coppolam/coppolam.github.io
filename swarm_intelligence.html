      <h1>Designing robotic swarms</h1>
      <p><strong>Small robots have limited perception and processing power. This is an inconvenient truth that we have to deal with. With swarm intelligence, however, we can unlock their potential by enabling them to work together.</strong></p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
      <h3>A novel algorithm for emergent behavior</h3><!-- /wp:heading -->
      <p>In a recently published work, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11721-019-00163-0">available (open access) on the Swarm Intelligence Journal</a>, we proposed a new way to enable swarms of robots with limited knowledge and no communication to arrange into a larger pattern.</p>
      <p>How limited were the robots? They were anonymous, without memory, reactive, homogeneous, could not communicate, could not plan ahead, and had no global positioning (no GPS). They did not know anything except the current relative position of their closest neighbors and a knowledge of North. How, then, could we make them form patterns together?</p>
      <h3>The three rules of swarming</h3><!-- /wp:heading -->
      <p>We developed an algorithm that follows three simple and intuitive rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Be safe (avoid collisions)</li>
        <li>Be social (avoid moving away from peers)</li>
        <li>Be happy (stay in desired local states)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first two rules allow the swarm to reshuffle freely while never separating in multiple groups or experiencing collisions. The third rule tells robots to remain in "desired" states. These are local state observations whereby the agent is "happy", and thus does not move. The global goal (in this case a pattern) is achieved once all robots are "happy". They form the pattern by self-organizing into the correct "puzzle-piece" that forms the "puzzle".</p>

      </div>
      <p>Additionally, the paper introduces a novel verification procedure to check whether the swarm will always achieve its goal when starting from arbitrary initial conditions. The novelty of this procedure is that it analyzes the local state and action space of an agent, <strong>meaning that we can verify a global property by a local inspection of the behavior of a single robot</strong>, rather than looking at the swarm as a whole.<br></p>
      <p>You can see the algorithm in action in the video below.</p>

      <h2>Optimizing the behavior of swarms</h2>
      <p>The theory developed in the above provided us with a reliable method for "clueless" robots to arrange into larger structure, but how could we enable them to do so efficiently? Just as with many other modern developments, machine learning plays an important role in swarm intelligence. But machine learning needs data, and in this case, “data” often means computationally expensive simulations where robots try out different behaviors, eventually learning how to fulfill a task. This causes several scalability problems when dealing with larger swarms or complex tasks.</p>
      <p><strong>Our <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11721-019-00172-z">recent paper</a> use Google's PageRank algorithm to evaluate and optimize the behavior of swarms in a computationally efficient way, aimed at making swarms that are scalable, flexible, and robust.</strong></p>

      <h3>The PageRank algorithm</h3>
      <p>Our latest research provides a novel solution: <em>to use</em> <strong><em><strong><em>Google’s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank algorithm</a></em></strong></em></strong><em>&nbsp;in order to evaluate a behavior</em> <strong><em><strong><em>without any simulation</em></strong></em></strong><em>.</em> The PageRank algorithm was developed by the founders of Google back in the late ‘90s. Its objective was to sort through webpages and find the popular ones. This was done by evaluating how likely it would be for a web surfer to arrive at a webpage when clicking hyperlinks. This algorithm gave Google a competitive advantage.</p>
      <h3>Bringing the algorithm to swarms</h3>
      <p>Just as a web surfer surfs the web, we model the experiences of a robot "navigating" in the swarm. The states that the robot can be in become like websites to visit, and the actions that the robot can take become hyperlinks. Then, we use a PageRank based approach to evaluate how likely the robot is to end up in certain states, and learn behaviors that cause the robot to visit states that are beneficial to the swarm's goal. This is a computationally efficient method that requires no simulation. Because it only analyzes the behavior of a single robot, rather than the whole swarm, it allows to develop complex behaviors for larger swarms without the same scalability issues.<br></p>
